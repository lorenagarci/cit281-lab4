In this lab, I went through several steps to create an initial Fastify Node.js web server.

I set up the basic structure of the web server and then initialized the lab folder as a Node.js project using Node Package Manager. 
I also became more familiar with Fastify! I set up a git repository for version control, excluding the node_modules folder from being tracked, and made commits to save my progress. I was also tasked with fixing any MIME errors that were to occur, perform testing, and make another commit. 

I gained a hands-on experience in setting up a Fastify Node.js web server, utilizing npm for package management, and effectively using git for version control!
